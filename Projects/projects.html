        <h2 id="konsepti"> Concept: Wellbeing data's and Kanta PHR's further development</h2> 
        <header>
          <p class="image fit"><img src="../images/piritta.JPG" alt="" /></p>
        <p> The picture  above (Piritta Hiltunen, 2021 Hyvinvointitietojen ja Omatietovarannon jatkokehityksen konsepti, s. 20) summarises the whole consept's overview and goal situtation. In the next chapter I provide more details about the conseptualization. </p>
          <h3> Backround <br />
          </h3>
        </p>THL prepares the conceptualization always before the development of a new Kanta service or before significant new functionality or content of patient information systems development. The concept is also drawn up before the decision on a significant change to a existing service. The concept describes how the new Kanta service or new functionality supports the healthcare and social welfare services processes.
        <p>
            <p> Conceptualizations where relatively new subject in THL when I started my work there. I worked on the project as a trainee with the projects project manager. My responsibility laid on understanding the app developers perspective in our concept's context. 
            </p>  
          <p><p>
            <h3> Project <br />
            </h3>
          <p>The project can be described by following steps</p>
          <header>
          <h4>1. Research 
          </h4>
          </p> Only one conceptualization had been done before ours so THL's conceptualizations' procedure felt still a bit hazy once we started. For me this was a valuable lesson to learn since we had a lot of options and could work the way suited us best. 
          <p>
          <p>We started the work by learning about the Kanta PHR service, anticipatory social wellfare and healthcare, wellness applications and their market and how that market could be supported. We had multiple different work groups with professionals who had been working with the PHR in different roles. The stakeholders included wellness app vendors and public officers from organizations such as HL7 and Kela. With their help and pur research we gained a good amount of knowledge to begin with.
          </p>
          <p>During our regular meetings with stakeholders we always modified our consept draft based on the feedback or ideas gained from the meetings. In addition to the regular meetings we decided to held workshops for larger groups of wellness app vendors and public officers. </p>
          <header>
          <h4>2. Defining 
          </h4>
          </p> After the workshops we went trough all the collected data carefully. We used a Google Jamboard canvas during the workshops and the participants had an opportunity to vote the ideas they found to be the most important ones. </p>
        <p> We analyzed the data from the workshops and categorized it. 
        </p>  
          <header>
          <h4>3. Developing </h4>
          <p> Based on the discoveries we held more workshops that quided us closer to our goal. After the all five workshops we finished our draft of the consept. </p>
        <p>Next we took the consept to a official consultation round.  During it actors had a opportunity to give feedback on the draft consept.
          </p> 
          <header>
            <h4>4. Delivering</h4>
        </p> We went through the comments and made all necessary changes to the consept. After this the consept was published and afterwards it has been a quideline for Kanta PHR's development.

      <h2 id ="maarays">Regulation 6/2021 <br />
      </h2>
      <p class="image fit"><img src="../images/maarayskansikuva.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <header>
    <h3> Backround <br />
    </h3>
  </p> The regulation has two parts: 1. the regulation itself and 2. the essential requirements of wellness applications which defined in details the requirements welness apps need to fullfill in order to integrate with Kanta PHR.
    <p>
      <p>
        Social and health care data management and electronic processing of customer data are governed by THL's regulations based on the Customer Data Act. When the Customer Data Act was renewed, the need arose to regulate the essential requirements and certification of welfare applications.
      </p>  
    <p>This might not sound design related at all but the tools used for completing this project where quite service design oriented. In order to write the regulation and the essential requirements we needed to gather, analyze and summarise information from multiple different sources. While working on the regulation, I also increased my understanding of standards, information security and data protection requirements, and accessibility requirements.<p>
      <h3> Project <br />
      </h3>
    <p>The project can be described by following steps</p>
    <header>
    <h4>1. Research 
    </h4>
    </p> We started the project by doing a broad research on the topic. We looked into how other THL's regulations are written, what's the legal foundation of THL's regulations and what are the key areas this regulation aims to cover. This part was done by searching available information and by discussing with multiple THL's and external organisation's experts.
    <p>
    <p>My responsibilities laid especially on health applications usability and accessibility criterias. We based the essential requirements on the WCAG-criteria and had discussions about the needed accessibility level with AVI, which monitors compliance with accessibility requirements in Finland. In addition to this I studied the ISO/TS 82304-2:2021 standard and made suggestions of which requirements we should add to our essential requirements.
    </p>
    <header>
    <h4>2. Analyzing 
    </h4>
    </p> After the research work, we reviewed and compiled the information we received into a preliminary version of the regulation.We evaluated the regulation from the perspectives of the various actors it will affect. We held discussions with the entities that guide us and prepared the regulation for it's comment round.</p>
    <header>
    <h4>3. Feedback </h4>
    </p> In the feedback phase, we organized a consultation round, during which actors had the opportunity to give feedback on the draft regulation.
    </p> 
    <header>
      <h4>4. Refining</h4>
  </p> Based on the comments received, we modified the regulation and its essential requirements.

  <h2 id ="OmaEläke">Case: OmaEläke <br />
  </h2>
  <p> Ilmarinen and the University of jyväskylä collaborated in a information systems sciense master's project course where students' were assigned to redesign their Omaeläke application. I worked as a UX-designer in our project and I was responsible of our solutiom prototype and all of our visual elements</p>
  <p class="image fit"><img src="../images/omaelake.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<header>
<h3> Problem statements <br />
</h3>
</p> Our customer Ilmarinen had identified following problems with their current OmaEläke application<p>
  <p>
    1. Customer engagement with the application is not high enough </p>  
<p> 2. Customers are not following their pension accruals actively throughout their working life.<p>
  <h3> Solving the problems <br />
  </h3>
<p>During the course we followed the MINDS Method <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1094670516680033?journalCode=jsra" ></a> in our OmaEläke applications redesign. We also learned by the course literature how value is co-created and how we could this way improve the customer engagement. </p>
<header>
<h4> Ideas  
</h4>
</p> We started by making affinity diagrams and interviewing people about what they would like to know about their pension. After collecting data this way and from course materials we finished our affinity diagram and our user personas.<p class="image fit"><img src="../images/maija.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>After gaining feedback we moved to creating a storyboard of our user Maija. This was followed by service experience blueprints and UX/wireframe sketches. All of these tasks were solely my responsibility. I gathered our ideas and formed them into visualizations.</p>
<header>
<h4>Prototype</h4>
</p> I built the prototype using Figma. After visualizing all of our needed pages I tested it within our group and based on the group's feedback I finished it to its final form. During the course's time limit I only had time to create the functionalities presented in our storyboard etc. so some of our ideas can't be tried in the prototype even though they can be seen as headers. 
</p> 
<header>
  <h3>Presenting our solution</h3>
</p> At the end of the course University organised an event where all of the course's groups' solutions where presented. All students, professors and the customer Ilmarinen had an opportunity to vote for the solution they tought deserved to win the contest. Our solution won the contest and Ilmarinen told us that it was excactly a solution they were hoping to find since it tackled all of the problems with the current OmaEläke application. <p>

    <h2 id ="covid">Covid-19 innovations <br />
    </h2>
    <p> The pandemic affected students' wellbeing in numerous ways. I was working in University of Jyväskylä's student ambassador group called IT Crew when Finland faced the lockdowns. We had to face the challenges of the pandemic and react to them quickly. Here are few examples of what we did to increase students wellbeing during the pandemic.</p>
    <p class="image fit"><img src="../images/us.png" alt="" /></p>
  <header>
  <h3> Problem statements <br />
  </h3>
  </p> Our faculty started to get messages and other kind of feedback from students early in the spring of 2020. Students were experiencing loneliness, anxiety and lack of motivation. We collaborated with Nyyti ry to gain deeper understanding on student's issues. Based on the conversations we also sent questionaries for students to hear directly from them how the pandemic is affecting them.<p>
    <p>Based on the information we identified following problems: </p>
    <p> 1. Especially freshmen are feeling lonely and have difficulties studying</p>  
    <p> 2. Students writing their theses have hard time finishing their theses </p>
    <p> 3. Students are feeling bored and stressed since they can't participate in their usual leisure activities </p>
    <h3> Solving the problems <br />
    </h3>
  <p>We had workshops where we tried to innovate solutions that could fix the student challenges or at least ease them. We identified different kind of students and wanted to give everyone something. We took this into the consideration while marketing the remote events and always made sure that the students knew that no matter what group they could only join and there was no pressure to participate in to the conversations if they didn't want to.</p>
  <p> We had an idea to organise everything with the ideology: from us to us. This meant that students were always welcome to give us feedback from the remote events we had held. After the worst part of the pandemic students were also included to organise events such as new honny try outs by themselves. </p>
  <header>
  <h4> First aid   
  </h4>
  </p> When the lockdowns were still on we held peer support groups via Zoom to help students with different challenges. There were different kinds of groups such as thesis group and coffee break group. We even heald groups that lasted for the whole day to give students structure to their days. The groups soon became popular and were masketed in other faculties too.
  <p></p>
  <h4>Keeping up with the situation</h4>
  </p> We tried to gather data from students regularily to see how the groups are helping them. Many replied that even though they haven't participated they feel easier since they know that groups like that exist. Based on the feedback and changing covid restrictions we evolved the from us to us consept and started having face to face meetings too. We marketed all of this in our podcast called AaamukahvIT and in our university's email lists.</p>
